# shufflefileorder
Shuffles the file order of a folder.

Place shuffle.py in the directory where the folder you want to shuffle is located.
Run shuffle.py with Python 3.

Make sure the shuffled folder is sorted in alphabetical order.
The program adds a unique random number in front of every file, "randomizing" the order of the files.

You can also unshuffle any folder that has been shuffled.
When shuffle.py is run, it creates a unique txt file for every shuffled folder named <folder name>shufflehistory.txt.
If you wish to unshuffle the folder back to its original version at a later point, do not delete this txt file.
